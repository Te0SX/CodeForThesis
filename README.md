### Title: Optimizing Blue Growth Services to Aquaculture Farms using the ODYSSEA Platform

### Abstract

This thesis focuses on how the fast-growing aquaculture industry could benefit from Open Big Data collected by Earth Observing Systems, optimizing its daily operation and their Business Plan Development using the ODYSSEA platform and its integrated services. Through the ODYSSEA Platform, historic, present and forecasted marine data, in friendly to end user formats, can be downloaded and processed, increasing the production and sustainability of fish farms. The use of such data could optimize the process for selecting the best possible location to setup or expand their plans, or notice environmental changes in a time frame which would indicate that they should take actions to prepare for future alarming conditions.

In the present thesis:

* Marine Data in CSV and NetCDF format have been retrieved using ODYSSEA platform and Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) at the locations in which 10 fish farms operate in Greece, covering the period of the last 20 years.
* A Database was built with the main oceanographic and environmental parameters potentially affecting fish-farming. Data analysis was carried out, including Descriptive Statistical Analysis on each environmental parameter, Principal Component Analysis to assess the main parameters determining the variability of the system, and the Peak-Over-Threshold method to understand the nature and probability of occurrence of extreme events.
* For the Analysis, Python and R languages were used.

In the second part of the thesis, water sensors are reviewed as an alternative method to Satellite-based Information Systems, how they could transform Smart Coasting and impact Blue Growth. Sensors enable accurate, qualitative observation of specific coastal locations where the exact monitoring of environmental conditions is crucial. Such locations could include aquaculture farms, since the environmental changes observed at the farm and the surrounding area influence key aspects of production, such as fish food utilization, fish growth, product quality, welfare, disease treatment, mortality and environmental impact.

Considering Internet of Things and other emerging technologies, it will be investigated how low-cost highly-efficient water sensors could be introduced in aquaculture, enabling Smart Coasting. A Proof of Concept will be constructed with a sensor using Lora technology and IOTA’s Data Marketplace, demonstrating an example of how water sensors could play a key role in Blue Economy in the foreseeable future. Proof of Concept was programmed using JavaScript language.
